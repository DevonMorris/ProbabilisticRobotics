# MeEn595: Autonomous Systems as taught by Dr. McClain
The objective of this course is to learn foundational techniques and algorithms for localization, mapping, and planning for robotic vehicles. The methods we will use will take into consideration uncertainties in environments, sensors, and dynamics. We will also consider, albeit in less detail, decision making in the presence of uncertainty.

## Lab 1: Kalman Filter
Implementing a Kalman Filter to estimate the states of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).
